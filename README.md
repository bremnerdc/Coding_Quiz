# Coding_Quiz 

A **Javascript coding quiz** created in *Vanilla JavaScript* to test your knowledge with basic Javascript questions.

Application Description:

Using JavaScript I coded the following:

* Created a timer that started counting down from 60 when the user started the quiz. 
* New questions will appear after the user chooses an answer.
* The application will test whether or not the user's answer is correct, if incorrect subtract 15 seconds from the user's remaining time.
* Stop the timer and end the quiz if the user runs out of time or completes all the questions on the quiz.
* Record the user's score; which is the amount of time the user had left on the timer when the quiz ends, and save the user's intitials to local storage.
* Display all high scores and saved initials in list on high score page.
